# Pointers to learn Web Development

You do not need to learn everything of any language or framework, <b>NOBODY DOES</b>. You just need to know the basics and where to find the information you need. In fact how to find the thing you need is the most important skill you need to have.

You will find everything on the youtube / internet. Just to give you a head start, here are some pointers.

- All in one:
    - [Crash Course 1: using React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU)
        
        This is actually good. You can replace the postgres part with MySQL if you want to use MySQL. (Using Postgres is also okay.) 
        
        Also, using postgres and MySQL is not that different. You can easily switch between them.

I have been quite a far from the web development world. So, If you find any better resources, please let me know. I will update the list.

Thanks for reading. Have a good day.
